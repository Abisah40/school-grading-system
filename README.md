The school grading system in Nigeria varies depending on the level of education (primary, secondary, or tertiary) and the curriculum followed (national or international). Below is an overview:

### **Primary and Secondary Education**
In Nigerian schools that follow the national curriculum, grading is usually based on a percentage system. Here's a general breakdown:

- **80-100%**: A (Distinction/Excellent)
- **70-79%**: B (Very Good)
- **60-69%**: C (Good)
- **50-59%**: D (Average/Fair)
- **40-49%**: E (Pass)
- **Below 40%**: F (Fail)

Students are assessed through continuous assessments (classwork, homework, projects) and final exams. The overall grade typically reflects performance in these areas.

#### International Curricula
Some private schools in Nigeria follow international systems like the British (IGCSE), American, or International Baccalaureate (IB). Grading in these schools aligns with the standards of their respective systems.

### **Tertiary Education**
In Nigerian universities, the grading system is based on a Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA), which uses a 5-point scale. Here's the breakdown:

| **Grade** | **Score (%)** | **Grade Point** | **Class of Degree**        |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------|----------------------------|
| A         | 70-100        | 5.0             | First Class                |
| B         | 60-69         | 4.0             | Second Class Upper Division|
| C         | 50-59         | 3.0             | Second Class Lower Division|
| D         | 45-49         | 2.0             | Third Class                |
| E         | 40-44         | 1.0             | Pass                       |
| F         | Below 40      | 0.0             | Fail                       |

### **Key Features**
1. **National Examinations:**  
   - At the secondary level, students take standardized exams like the **West African Senior School Certificate Examination (WASSCE)**, administered by WAEC, and the **NECO exams**, conducted by the National Examinations Council.
   - Grading in WASSCE and NECO is based on letters (A1-F9), where A1 (75-100%) is the highest and F9 is the lowest.

2. **Continuous Assessment:**  
   Both primary and secondary schools place emphasis on continuous assessment to ensure a holistic evaluation of students' abilities.

3. **Standardization Across Levels:**  
   WAEC and NECO grades are often used to determine admission into tertiary institutions alongside UTME scores, which are administered by JAMB (Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board).
